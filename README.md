# JEE COLLEGE PREDICTOR
A machine learning project designed to predict the potential colleges a student can gain admission to based on their JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) rank and other relevant features. With an accuracy of 81.6%, this model provides a reliable tool for aspirants to make informed decisions about their college preferences.

## Features
Input Parameters: JEE rank, category, home state, preferred branch, and more.
Output: List of probable colleges and branches based on past admission trends.
Model Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 81.6% through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
## Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
Pandas for data preprocessing
NumPy for numerical operations
Scikit-learn for building and optimizing the machine learning model
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
## Workflow
Data Collection: Historical data of JEE admission trends.
Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Model Selection: Trained multiple classification algorithms; final model chosen based on accuracy and precision.
Evaluation: Achieved 81.6% accuracy on the test dataset.
